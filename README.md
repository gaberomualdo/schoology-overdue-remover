# Schoology Overdue Remover (Chrome Extension)

A simple Chrome/Chromium extension to remove the overdue box on Schoology. Currently only works on ASL's Schoology installation (as of 2020-02-21), on `lms.asl.org`.

## Usage

This Chrome extension is currently private and can only be used via the following instructions (as of 2020-02-21):

1. Download the extension's source code (on GitHub).

2. Open your Chromium-based web browser of choice, and go to **Menu (3 dots) > More Tools > Extensions**.

3. On the top right corner, drag the slider titled **Developer Mode** to be turned on.

4. On the top left, click **Load Unpacked** and select the folder of the extension's source code.

5. Done. The extension should now be loaded and the overdue box should be gone for good!

## License and Credits

I, Fred Adams, was the sole creator and developer behind this Chrome extension. It was pretty simple and fast to build, and took around half-an-hour.

I've licensed this under the MIT license. More information on licensing can be found at `LICENSE.txt`.

It's also important to note that this extension is really only relevant to students at ASL or others that use Schoology at their school. The repo for this extension on GitHub has thus been privatized for that reason (as of 2020-02-21).
